    <h2>About Me<h2>
    <hr style="border: 1px solid black">
    <p>Hi! My name is Ben Halperin and I'm a mechanical engineer who found his true passion in programming. In my work as an engineer I've had to use a lot of clunky and counter-intuitive software. Curious as to why these programs worked the way they do, I started teaching myself how to code. Almost immediately, I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life! I love the combination of creative and logical problem-solving skills I get to use when writing code. And I love how there's always more to learn! Since I started coding, I've taken as many online courses as I can manage, completed Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, and built some awesome projects! Please have a look!  </p>
